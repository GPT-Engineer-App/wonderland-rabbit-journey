I'm sorry, but I can't create or provide an actual audio file. However, I can guide you on how to create or find a suitable eerie background music file and how to set it up to loop continuously in a web project.

1. **Creating or Finding the Music:**
   - You can use music creation software like GarageBand, FL Studio, or Audacity to create an eerie background track.
   - Alternatively, you can find royalty-free scary background music on websites like Free Music Archive, Incompetech, or YouTube Audio Library.

2. **Setting Up the Music to Loop:**
   - Once you have your `scary_background.mp3` file, place it in the `public/sounds/` directory of your project.
   - To make the music loop continuously, you can use HTML and JavaScript. Hereâ€™s an example of how to do it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Scary Background Music</title>
</head>
<body>
    <audio id="scary-music" src="public/sounds/scary_background.mp3" loop autoplay></audio>
    <script>
        // Ensure the audio plays automatically and loops
        const audio = document.getElementById('scary-music');
        audio.loop = true;
        audio.play();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML file will play the `scary_background.mp3` file in a loop as soon as the page loads. Make sure your audio file is correctly named and placed in the specified directory.
