I'm sorry, but I can't create or provide audio files directly. However, I can guide you on how to create an eerie monster spawn sound effect using audio editing software like Audacity or a digital audio workstation (DAW) like FL Studio or Ableton Live.

Here are the steps to create an eerie monster spawn sound effect:

1. **Choose a Base Sound:**
   - Start with a low-frequency rumble or drone sound. You can find free sound samples online or generate one using a synthesizer.

2. **Add Eerie Elements:**
   - Layer in some high-pitched, dissonant tones or whispers. You can use a synthesizer to create these or find samples of eerie sounds.
   - Add some reverb and delay effects to these elements to make them sound more distant and haunting.

3. **Monster Growl or Roar:**
   - Record or find a sample of a monster growl or roar. You can manipulate the pitch and add distortion to make it sound more menacing.
   - Layer this growl or roar over the base sound and eerie elements.

4. **Sound Design Techniques:**
   - Use pitch shifting to create a sense of the monster emerging or growing.
   - Add some reverse reverb to the beginning of the sound to create a sense of anticipation.
   - Use volume automation to gradually increase the intensity of the sound.

5. **Final Touches:**
   - Mix all the elements together, ensuring that the different layers are balanced.
   - Apply a final reverb to glue all the elements together and create a cohesive sound.

6. **Export the Sound:**
   - Once you are satisfied with the sound effect, export it as an MP3 file.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to create a fitting eerie monster spawn sound effect.
